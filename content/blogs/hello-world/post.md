## Hello, world. This is me Laurent.
I've recently came up with an idea to start blogging. I got inspired by a colleague
 that already does some blogging. Over here I'd like to share my own experiences in, for example vibe-coding an app from scratch
 or a life experience that I had. It could be interesting for others to read, and for myself to read upon it later.
I always like to store memories in all kinds of way to reflect back on it. In this way; writing it publicly - I have never done it, but it is interesting.
Usually I would film or video it, but by writing it can really be articulated from brain to text, if you get what I mean.

## What you can expect

Short, honest posts about things I go through and what I experience along the way of lifes.

• things I learn as a developer

• music, creativity, and inspiration

• thoughts on discipline, growth, doubts

• lifestyle: travel, Dublin vibes, random experiences

• my projects 

• maybe even a video now and then

## Why I’m doing this

I want a place to document things, not perfect, but genuine.  
Somewhere to share, reflect, and maybe inspire someone who’s on a similar path.

## What’s next?

I’m keeping it simple.

Sometimes a short post, sometimes a longer breakdown, sometimes just one insight from that day.

Thanks for being here.

Let’s see where this goes.
